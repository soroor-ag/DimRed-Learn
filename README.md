# DimRed-Learn: Hands-on Dimensionality Reduction with PCA & LDA

This repository contains a simple, guided project designed for students to **learn and practice dimensionality reduction techniques** in machine learning using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** and **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)**.

## üìå Project Overview

The project is structured as a series of exercises to help understand:

1. **Data preprocessing & visualization**

   - Load dataset, pick sample images from each class
   - Add Gaussian noise and visualize noisy vs. clean images
2. **PCA from scratch**

   - Implement PCA without using ML libraries
   - Compute explained variance ratio
   - Determine the number of components needed to preserve ‚â•90% variance
3. **PCA with scikit-learn**

   - Reduce data to 2 principal components
   - Visualize in 2D scatter plots (color-coded by class)
4. **Image reconstruction using PCA**

   - Project noisy images into PCA subspace
   - Reconstruct and compare clean, noisy, and reconstructed images
5. **LDA with scikit-learn**

   - Reduce data to 2 discriminant components
   - Visualize results and compare with PCA
6. **Class separability analysis**

   - Compute Fisher‚Äôs criterion: `trace(Sw‚Åª¬π Sb)`
   - Analyze effect of number of features on separability
   - Identify optimal number of features

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow, scikit-learn
